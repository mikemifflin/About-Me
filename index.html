   <h3>Late night discussion</h3>
                My understanding of what comes to be,</p> is only limiting my own reality,</p> define this life, which can twist and turn,</p> only to burn whats left to learn.</p> Unconditioned years of total blindness</p> focused on our mere sight of silence.</p> Darkness draped over our eyes wide shut,</p> deceiving and repeating lies lied shut.</p> 
        
                Unlearn what you have learned in order to escape,</p> this prison that is created through our own dreamscape.</p>
        
                Break through the walls of our own demise,</p> and shine with divine inspirited minds.</p> 
        
                But first we all must walk a path of that is unclear,</p> dampened by our egos and disguised with fear.</p> Almost destroying our well being of love,</p> damaging us until we plead from above.</p> 
        
                Little do we know, above is within,</p> without is our hell which we all claim to live in.</p> Designed and defined by our thoughts of self,</p> the life that we create is like nothing else.</p> So take this time, and free your mind</p>
